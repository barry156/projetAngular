# Projet2
Welcome to this dynamic web application, generated with Angular CLI version 15.0.5. This project is dedicated to creating a user-friendly platform for a travel agency. Our mission is to provide tourists with the means to discover incredible destinations around the world, conveniently categorized by continents.
## Getting Started

If you're new to Angular or looking to expand your skills, Projet2 serves as an excellent learning resource. To begin your journey, clone this repository and explore the codebase.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
